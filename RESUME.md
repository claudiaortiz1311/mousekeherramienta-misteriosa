# 🧠 Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)

Applicant Tracking Systems are softwares that filter and rank job applications by scanning resumes for relevant information and keywords. They help companies reduce the number of resumes to review by automatically evaluating how closely a candidate matches a job description.

# ✅ How to make an ATS-proof resume

- Identify the keywords (analyze the most relevant words connected to your professional role).

- Distribute them naturally throughout the CV.

- Pay attention to the format (PDF or DOCX depending on what the company requests).

- Use a clear and simple structure—ATS struggle with overly complex formatting.

- Include dates (ATS often track years of experience and timeline consistency).
